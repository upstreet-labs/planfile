- fix vrm object rendering, and loadout-manager update approved
- big regression today, leads to hard reset to 5 days ago
  - when below happens, `offscreen-engine` is generated twice, then refered `engine-worker.js` in `https://app.webaverse.online` instead of `https://local.webaverse.online` which is surely not the recent version, because origin is `https://local.webaverse.online`, which is not handled at all.(https://github.com/upstreet-labs/app/blob/c6d2eb0478c423a9842ae635932ed018f089e6f2/constants.js#L79)
    - need to find out why `offscreen-engine` is created twice
      - first `offscreen-engine` is created in main thread, which is normal
      - second `offscreen-engine` is created in `engine.html` thread by npc-manager's default player create, and avatar rendering
    - do i need to add another case for previewhost url?
    - conclusion: maybe i shouldn't create local player in npc-manager constructor to avoid duplicated `offscreen-engine` creation in main and `engine.html` thread
  - (main reason) app transplant on local player creation happened before the party-manager appsArray mapping, leads to transplant failure. need to reimplement this considering multiplayer and multi scene change scenario.
- WIP of optimizer crash on multiple quality change request (highest priority now)

- (management) dev team organized to train and filter new comers with same standard level of labs members who passed hiring process. this will be debating role to do though. my plan is to:
  - check tasks members are working on / reassign with higher priority tasks
  - do peer review for updates
  - track work hours / filter out members with non full-time working (weekly based)
  - track status of WIP / remind / evaluate and report performance
  - discuss about tasks/project
