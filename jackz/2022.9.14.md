- fix vrm object rendering, and loadout-manager update approved
- big regression today, leads to hard reset to 5 days ago
  - offscreen-engine refered `engine-worker.js` in `https://app.webaverse.online` instead of `https://local.webaverse.online`, because origin is `https://local.webaverse.online`, which is not handled at all.(https://github.com/upstreet-labs/app/blob/c6d2eb0478c423a9842ae635932ed018f089e6f2/constants.js#L79)
    - do i need to add another case for previewhost url?
    - how was this even working on original version?
  - app transplant on local player creation happened before the party-manager appsArray mapping, leads to transplant failure. need to reimplement this considering multiplayer and multi scene change scenario.
- WIP of optimizer crash on multiple quality change request
