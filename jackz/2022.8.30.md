- WIP of app manager refactoring. world and partymanager have app manager now, instead of world and localplayer. Still working on refactoring considering multiplayer. Each game player will need to have partymanager, not just single remote player. The zdoc need to have another one hierachy called partyMap so that it can manage relation between party and characters. In the end, this will need the full test of multiplayer with two players using party system.
- WIP of using same source for generating controlObject in avatar renderer to remove duplicated model loading. Previous one imports glb from buffer directly. Update includes create the control object in optimizer using skeleton and morphs only and serialize it back to avatar renderer. Concern is that deserializing still happens on avatar renderer and the performance gain is not obvious.
- WIP of fixing crash bug on multiple Home/End key press. Aborting previous avatar optimizer call break things and leads to memory leak.
