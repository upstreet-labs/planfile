- WIP of app manager refactor. world and partymanager has app manager, instead of world and localplayer
- WIP of using same source for generating controlObject in avatar renderer. Previous one imports glb from buffer directly. Update includes create the control object in optimizer using skeleton and morphs only and serialize it back to avatar renderer. Concern is that deserializing still happens on avatar renderer to the performance gain is not obvious.
