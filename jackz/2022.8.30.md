- WIP of app manager refactor. world and partymanager has app manager, instead of world and localplayer. Still working on refactoring considering multiplayer. Each game player will need to have partymanager, not just single remote player.
- WIP of using same source for generating controlObject in avatar renderer. Previous one imports glb from buffer directly. Update includes create the control object in optimizer using skeleton and morphs only and serialize it back to avatar renderer. Concern is that deserializing still happens on avatar renderer to the performance gain is not obvious.
- WIP of fixing crash bug on multiple Home/End key press. Aborting previous optimizer call break things and leads to memory leak.

- Resolve conflict of above PR after belopots refactoring
