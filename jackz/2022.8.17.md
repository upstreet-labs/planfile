- Party system upgraded. Shares `npc-manager` with player and npcs. `LocalPlayer` is in `party-manager`'s appManager. When npc joins party, it's app is transplanted to `LocalPlayer`, and also transplanted on new `LocalPlayer` when switching members. `party-manager` is not touched when scene changes.
