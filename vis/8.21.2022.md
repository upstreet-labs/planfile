- Fix wrong physical speed and animations jitter in low fps issues ( Make them "frame rate independent" ). ( 2nd try ) https://github.com/upstreet-labs/app/pull/8
  - Remove the need of `isBoundPlayer` arg
    Now in `spriter` mode, calc/set `avatar.velocity` in `avatar-spriter.js`, don't need calc it in `avatar.js` anymore.
    In normal mode, keep copying `avatar.velocity` from `player/character.characterPhysics.velocity` in `player-avatar-binding.js`.
    So don't need distinguish these two situations through `isBoundPlayer` arg.
