1-I have been working on: - Pure WASM Animation porting:
  - 1) Prevent transfer `string`s between js and wasm, use int instead, to improve performance, and make draft pr.
  - 2) Port `cubicBezier` function to wasm side.
  - 3) Clean codes and logics, mainly to reuse js info, prevent duplicate logics on wasm side.
2-My goal till today's meeting was: - As above.
3-I succeeded/failed/partially succeeded in this goal:
  - 1) succeeded.
  - 2) partially. I can get `y` by `t`, but has problem get `y` by `x`, haven't found existing cpp implementation yet, maybe need deep investigate js version codes.
  - 3) partially.
4-My goal till tomorrow's meeting will be: - 2) 3)
