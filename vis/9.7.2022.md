1-I have been working on: - Keep improving WASM Anim Refactor.
2-My goal till today's meeting was: - As above.
3-I succeeded/failed/partially succeeded in this goal:
  - partially: 
    - Deleted all `motions/nodes` and tree structure on JS side, moved to WASM side.
    - `setWeight/Factor/speed` etc all on WASM side, triggered by only two js calls `updateAvatar` ( for number/floats ) and `updateAvatarString` ( for name/strings ), data passed through preallocated `scratchStack`.
