- work on these issues :
  - Avatar arms issue : https://github.com/upstreet-labs/app/issues/10
    - the modelBone position of the arms definitely change for this avatar
      ( maybe it's using some default modelBones for every avatar ?, that is unlikely but I'm seeing the exact same values for some bones for different avatars )
      ( I should add that we also have bone problems for some of the other avatars, it's not just this one )
      I'm still investigating... 

  - Avatar height issue : https://github.com/upstreet-labs/app/issues/11
