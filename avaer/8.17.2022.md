- rewrite avatar renderer update loop to be broken out into avatar/cull phases
- fixing avatar headshots in the UI: attempted to make the avatar renderer camera (used for frustum culling) a settable property. this was actually hard to do, because the avatar screenshotter is highly abstracted from the url load flow: it's url > totum vrm app > avatar renderer > avatar animator > npc > avatar screenshotter > offscreen engine > imageBitmap > canvas. nuts! why do we need a physics npc to capture an avatar's face? I also had to pass through components and marshall arguments just to make this work, which is bound to break when anyone touches a part of this pipeline in the future. I'm scrapping that idea completely; will instead collapse the preview to just the avatar renderer + avatar animator, which is all we need to correctly pose an avatar for a headshot. this idea is taken from the avatar spriter, which despite its complexity is very clean. should also be faster to load and easier to maintain that way.
- patch avatar renderer into character ui panel, hups, and megahups
