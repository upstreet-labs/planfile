- tested + deployed the diffsound `txt2sound` model in the metaversefile api
- I'm hoping to devote the rest of this week to worldgen for land claims
- did another review pass of mostly avatar-related issues
- made a pass over current gameplay annoyances/regressions that will probably get in the way of gameplay/worldgen:
  - `animations-baker.js` no longer works (THREE.js update problem)
  - wear/drop item does not have sound
  - sword does not grunt or whoosh
  - double jump does not have sfx
  - missing slash fx for sword (I saw this from @Vis but never made it into the engine)
  - darkneess.scn all apps are broken
  - new jump falling animation needs to be integrated
  - avatar spriter is run twice (second time for avatar iconer, you san see it hitching)
  - avatar quality change does not apply to npcs
  - avatar quality changer is not in sync with the graphics settings
  - iframe offscreen engine should move to OffscreenCanvas
  - physics manager should be rewritten to not query getPhysicsObjects, but register instead
  - land rendering is broken
  - tilde grab offsetting is both glitched and lagged behind camera
- rewrote `animations-baker.js` -> `animations-baker.mjs`. this was mostly quite easy, because `node` now supports `fetch`, which was the biggest API hangup
