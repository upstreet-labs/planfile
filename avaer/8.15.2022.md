  - success! turned out this needed 2 GL layers in addition to the DOM layer. first layer: black background opacity 1 (cover up background); second layer: multiply white opacity 0 (punch out dom element).
- removed sRGB pass from r143 post processing
- set sRGB encoding for SSAOPass + shaders
- threejs updated to respect WebGLRenderTarget setting, not just in XR mode (why was it written that way?)
- add sRGB encoding chunks to shaders (metaverse modules, apps, SSAO)
