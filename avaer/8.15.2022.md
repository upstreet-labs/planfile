  - success! turned out this needed 2 GL layers in addition to the DOM layer. first layer: black background opacity 1 (cover up background); second layer: multiply white opacity 0 (punch out dom element).
- removed metaversefile .react  internal PQS transform (hard to find). instead, put PQS as a wear subcomponent of the NPC in the scene file. it's more natural to configure what the NPC is wearing there, where you define the NPC.
- removed sRGB pass from r143 post processing and patched resulting bugs
- set sRGB encoding for SSAOPass + shaders
- threejs updated to respect WebGLRenderTarget setting, not just in XR mode (why was it written that way?)
- add sRGB encoding chunks to shaders (metaverse modules, apps, SSAO)
- bugfix missing chest app react app destroy
- bugfix npc apps wear subapp unbind not working due to player destruction race condition
- adjust linear SSAO constants for visual effect
- Bugfix SSAO debug shaders toggle, especially depth render range
