- another merge day:
  - merged avatars -> character refactoring
  - merged scn file export to create proper scenes
  - merged misc scene updates
- reviewed new sick-ass party system by jack
  - almost good to merge, just some refactoring needed
- tried to iPhone-debug some more avatar renderer bindings in the middle of the night
- spent last night tracking down a bug where some parts of an avatar would not be skinned
  - turns out it only happens with some models, so wasted a couple hours trying to repro it with a working model
  - it only happens for the face mesh, not other me
  - probably has to do with exact materials setup/morphs
  - Jack helped with this
- debugged avatar renderer not having its control flag set by the avatar animator. easy fix but wasted 30 mins :(.
- cursory AI research
  - facebook vocoder
    - team is trying to resynthesize the ponies + somnium files on top of it
  - review diffsound deployment instructions
  - review stable-diffusion deployment requiements
- diffsound ai sound generation model has a new public model checkpoint, but baidu's great firewall was rolling back + resetting the model download
  - team member on the other side of the planet was able to route it to GDrive!
