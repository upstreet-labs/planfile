- adaptive tone mapping pass debugging (black render target in the passes). the problem was actually in the main webaverse render pass lacking a swap, causing the next pass to scribble over the source framebuffer when using a blur kernel
  - spector.js helped a lot to debug this! you can see that the pass framebuffer is destroyed by the next pass

- adjusted DOF/Bokeh constants to blur in the hundreds of meters, which is a typical scene depth
- reset pass shaders to three.js upstream, since we don't need reconstruction hacks for log depth buffer anymore
- research stable diffusion weights pull, so that we can deploy a hosted version of the image synthesis. this will probably replace dalle-mini since it's worlds better in terms of quality
- do not generate mipmaps for main render target, for performance
- rewrite Unreal bloom pass to do custom addition in the shader
- bugfix three-vrm incorrect `this` binding that was causing undefined parent reference during `three-vrm` `VRMSpringBone` `updateMatrixWorld`
- do not dynamically load default metaverse modules, and patch downstream dependencies -- this defers most of the loading and decreases load time. it is also mostly a pure win, since most of these modules were not used. the tradeoff is a slight load time increase when they are first used.
