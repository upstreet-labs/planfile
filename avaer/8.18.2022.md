- merged avatar optimizer to master
- version `0.59_dev`!
  - new avatar renderer
    - all avatar rendering is now going through the intermediate avatar renderer system, which stands in the middle of the scene graph and performs dynamic atlasing/spriting/material coalesce
    - optimization happens off-thread, which makes the offscreen engine a hard requirement. this will affect folks who were incorrectly using `localhost` to access the webaverse instance (it should be `https://local.webaverse.com/`).
    - now there is only one avatar in the scene -- the rendered one
    - skeleton and morphs bindings are achieved through a shadow avatar object. this be further optimized for memory and parse time by duplicating the skeleton and morphs objects only, from the multithreaded optimizer, rather than parsing the avatar again (even if this other copy is never rendered) 
    - can be hotswapped in realtime with a hotkey (currently `home`/`end`)
  - linear color pipeline enabled (sRGB is encoded in the shaders). this may or may not be a good approach -- the alternative is to do a final encoding pass in the end.
  - logarithmic depth buffer removed. should be a performance boost across the board, especially for expensive fragments due to enabling of earlier GPU tests.
    - many custom shader changes were needed
    - still might be some slight visual glitches at large distances
- bugfix card renderer avatar rendering to use new fast api
- parallelize card renderer pipeline (avatar, object, glyph) -> card svg -> imageBitmap
- more optimizations possible:
  - still need to enable lower quality avatar by default, based on GPU heuristic
  - still need to make npc avatars hot-swap based on avatar quality setting
  - can avoid second avatar parse with a thin skeleton/morphs binding instead of a second full parse (especiallty to avoid doubling on texture load)
  - physics lookups can be optimized to not use `getPhysicsObject`
  - re-enable post-sRGB pass if it's faster
