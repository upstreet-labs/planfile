Lots of coordinate stuff today...

working on story studio. about ready to PR the UI. going to work on the lore programming a bit now, then clean up the UI and drop it

also need to go make sure the gltf exporter work again in html, whoops, works in node though. just need to revert some stuff and publish a new npm package for meshbaker

slept after writing this so i'm still on this day i guess. time means nothing when there is infinite daylight right in front of you.

fixed the meshbaker code and publishing 0.0.2 to npm, just split the browser and node logic for now although it could easily be handled and integrated. no time.

working on story studio, should be able to ship alpha tonight. going to add frontend openai key and local storage now. if that gets done i'll start project planning the avatar optimizer and metaloot.
