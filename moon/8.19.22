first planfile - testing commit

pushed eslint to webaverse app on upstreet labs
next will push through all lint fixes to linter passes for entire repo
then set up jsconfig, relative imports and some basic package structure
probably last time we'll ever get to do this before big team

working on texture atlasing and baking for meshes in THREE
learning for self, cleaning up some old code, making into npm package meshbaker
avaer has a similar mesh baker thing but this is useful for the standalone apps and as a rest service

probably work on this all weekend
